# RFormer

This repository is an extension of [RFormer](https://github.com/AlvaroArroyo/RFormer.git), modified to fit the requirements of thesis research. The project builds upon the original implementation of Rough Transformers for time-series modeling.

---

## Requirements

For compatibility, the repository includes a `rformer.yml` file for setting up a conda environment with all necessary dependencies.

### Setting Up the Environment

To create and activate the environment:

```bash
conda env create -f rformer.yml
conda activate rformer
```

## Modifications & Extensions

This repository has been extended to align with the objectives of my thesis, including:
- Improved preprocessing for irregular time-series data
- Adjustments to transformer architecture for rough path embedding
- Additional evaluation metrics for performance analysis

Further modifications will be made to enhance explainability and robustness.
